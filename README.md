This project will digitize any Stoelting Lab Standard analog stereotax for about $50 per arm (so $100 to do left+right arms).

Instructions are fairly rudimentary at the moment, but the assembly should be fairly explanatory, as most parts just snap together.

You have to print the STL files here, then buy a digital readout scale from Amazon (one per arm, about $30 each as of Feb 2025) along with calipers (two per arm, about $8 each):

Note that the left and right arms have slightly different STL files, as they are almost (but not quite) mirror images of each other.

The digital readout scale is for the AP axis, and provides 0.01mm accuracy, same as most commercial digital stereotaxes, and far more than necessary for rat/mouse work. (The largest source of variability is the animal itself)

The calipers are for the RL and DV axes. There are several models, but you MUST get the one with the red/yellow/blue buttons. The others will not fit.

There are two options: one metal, and one plastic. The metal one has greater accuracy (0.01mm) but the plastic cone is good enough in my opinion (0.1mm). Either way, you have to cut the calipers slightly to fit. The plastic model can be cut easily by hand with simple wire cutters. The metal one requires tools and specialized bits to cut and grind.
