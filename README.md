This adapts any Stoelting Lab Standard analog stereotax to digital for about $50.

You have to print the STL files here, then snap in calipers from Amazon (currently about $8 as of Feb 2025):

Each arm requires four STL files, and two calipers. Note that the left and right arms have slightly different STL files, as they are almost (but not quite) mirror images.

There are several models of caliper. You MUST get the one with the red/yellow/blue buttons. The others will not fit in the STL parts I've made. There are again two options: one metal, and one plastic. The metal one has greater accuracy (0.01mm) but the plastic cone is good enough in my opinion (0.1mm). Either way, you have to cut the calipers slightly to fit. The plastic model can be cut easily by hand with simple wire cutters. The metal one requires tools and specialized bits to cut and grind.
